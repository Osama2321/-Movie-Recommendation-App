# -Movie-Recommendation-App

This Movie Recommendation App uses unsupervised learning techniques to suggest personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing patterns. Instead of relying on labeled data, the system uncovers hidden patterns and clusters within the dataset using techniques like K-Means Clustering or Collaborative Filtering (via matrix factorization or cosine similarity).

üîç Key Features:
Recommends movies based on genre similarity and user viewing history

Uses unsupervised methods to group similar users or movies

Lightweight and easy to integrate with any dataset

Suitable for scenarios with minimal user feedback or labels

üß† Techniques Used:
Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) for user or movie segmentation

Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) for visualization

Similarity Metrics (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) for recommendation logic
